# Titanic Survival Prediction

In this project, I explored the Titanic dataset and built a machine learning model to predict passenger survival.  
All the work was done in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas — data manipulation and analysis
- Scikit-learn — machine learning
- Seaborn — data visualization

## Project Steps
1. Load the data and perform basic Pandas operations
2. Build a baseline model using numerical features
3. Split the dataset into training and test sets
4. Train a Decision Tree Classifier (sklearn)
5. Handle missing values
6. Make predictions using the fitted model
7. Evaluate model accuracy
8. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Survival probability by Sex and Passenger Class (categorical features)
   - Survival probability by Age and Fare (numerical features)
   - Distribution vs. simple statistics (averages)
   - The “Golden feature” → Lifeboat information
9. Apply dummy encoding for categorical features
10. Build an improved model and compare results
11. Conclusion — measure improvements in accuracy
